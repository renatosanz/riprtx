**by Renato Sanchez** - *June 2024*

Welcome to my blog! I am Renato, a music enthusiast, programming lover, and pixel art fan. I’m currently in my 7th semester of a computer science degree at BUAP University. I have to say, I’ve never been more interested in art and computing than since I discovered processing and computer vision.

In this blog, you’ll find various topics related to computing and art (both digital and audio). The programming languages I use in my projects range from C, C++, and ASM to Python and JavaScript. On my YouTube and SoundCloud channels, I’ve been uploading beats that I produce. If you want to contact me for research or other projects, you can find my contact information on my GitHub profile. Here’s my web portfolio.

Thank you for taking the time to read my blog!
