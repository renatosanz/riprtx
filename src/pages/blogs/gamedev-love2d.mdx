Love2d is a great framework for getting into game development because many engines work with quite complex concepts behind the scenes. For this reason, I started using Love2d for personal basic projects, and I'm here to explain how to get started in this way.

## Installing Love2d

To run Love2d, you first need to install Lua, which is a powerful programming language used in many modern projects like **Neovim, web apps, and Roblox map-making**.

On Windows (Chocolatey):

```bash
choco install lua53
```

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install lua5.3 # or other versions
```

On other systems:

```bash
#------- Brew -------
brew install lua

#------- Arch-based (pacman) -------
sudo pacman -S lua

#------- On RHEL, CentOS, Rocky, and AlmaLinux -------
yum install epel-release
yum install lua

#------- On Fedora Linux -------
dnf install lua
```

Once you have installed Lua, Love2d will be available. I recommend visiting the [official website](https://Love2d.org/) and following the instructions depending on your system.

## Game Structure

Love2d works with 3 basic functions: `load()`, `update()`, `draw()`. Each of these functions must be declared in the main file named **main.lua**, which is essential for running Love2d (where all the physics, classes, objects, and other game elements are handled).

### main.lua

Here, we are going to write our first Love2d game! _So let's get started_. First, we need to put the functions into the `main.lua` file.

```lua
function love.load() end
function love.update(dt) end
function love.draw() end
```

Now, let’s discuss them.

#### `love.load()`

Inside this function, we are going to load all the necessary resources for the game; we can also create bodies, load images, set timers, define variables, etc. This is because some things don’t need to be loaded every frame, and here we can call them for later use.

#### `love.update(dt)`

Here, the game is updated every frame. This includes calculating math, angles, algorithms, and everything needed to draw the game. In this function, we’ll bind all the keys to wait for input and trigger actions.

#### `love.draw()`

Every character needs a sprite or a figure (at minimum), and inside this function, we declare this using `love.graphics` functions, giving us access to all the geometric functions to draw and paint sprites.

# Libraries

In this course, we can use the built-in functions of Love2d, but I think it’s unnecessary since many people on the internet have created a whole set of libraries ready to use. That’s why I’ve decided to present the libraries I use in my projects. I’m grateful to [a327ex](https://github.com/a327ex) for creating a Love2d blog where I learned a lot, and for making many libraries for Love2d.

I highly recommend checking out the documentation for each library. You can also check out this repo where there are more libraries for Love2d.

## Physics

<Card url="https://github.com/a327ex/windfield" />

This library is pretty easy to use because it sets up all the necessary components to handle a body. I like this because we don’t want problems while coding the game.

Windfield works like this: first, you create a world, then you can create bodies, joints, and apply physics.

Here’s an example:

```lua
Physics = require("path/to/windfield")

function love.load()
  -- create a world with no gravity
  world = Physics.newWorld(0,0) 

  -- create a rectangle at (0,0) with dimensions 10x30
  body = world:newRectangleCollider(0,0,10,30) 
  -- we can modify every attribute of the body
  body:setRestitution(0.1) 
end

function love.update(dt)
  -- update the world physics
  world:update(dt)
end

function love.draw() 
  -- draw the world (only body borders)
  world:draw()
end
```
