Love2d is a nice game framework to enter into game dev, that's because a lot of engines works with concepts pretty complex behind all these stuff. For this reason, I've started using Love2d on personal basic projects, so I'm here to explain to you how start on this way.

## Love2d Install

For run Love2d, first we have to install Lua, which is a powerful programming language used in a lot of actual projects like **Neovim, Web Apps and Roblox map-making**.

On Windows (Chocolatey ):

```bash
choco install lua53
```

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install lua5.3 #or other versions
```

On others systems:

```bash
#------- Brew -------
brew install lua

#------- Arch based (pacman) -------
sudo pacman -S lua

#------- On RHEL, CentOS, Rocky & AlmaLinux -------
 yum install epel-release
 yum install lua

#------- On Fedora Linux -------
 dnf install lua
```

Once you have installed Lua, Love2d will be available. I recommend that you visit the [official website](https://love2d.org/) and follow the instructions depending on your system.

## Game structure

Love2d works in 3 basic functions: `load(), update(), draw()`. Each of the previous functions must be declared on the principal file name **main.lua** which is essential to run Love2d (where's all of the physics, classes, objects and stuff of the game).

### main.lua

Here we going to write our first Love2d game! _So let's go_. First we need put the previous functions inside the `main.lua` file.

```lua
function love.load() end
function love.update(dt) end
function love.draw() end
```

Now let's talk about them.

#### `love.load()`

Inside this function we going to load all the stuff required for the game, also we can create bodies, load images, set timers, define varibles, etc. This because some things don't need to be loaded every frame and here we can call them to use later.

#### `love.update(dt)`

Here all the game is updated every frame, this includes calculate maths, angles, algorithms and everything needed to draw the game. In this function we'll bind all the keys to wait for an input and activate actions.

#### `love.draw()`

Every character need a sprite or a figure (minimun) and inside this function we going to declare this, using the `love.graphics` functions we have access to all the geometric functions to draw and paint sprites.  

# Libreries

On this course we can use the build-in functions of love2d but I think this is not nessesary when already many people on the internet have constructed a whole of libreries ready to use. That's why I decided to present the libs I use on my proyects. I thanks to [a327ex](https://github.com/a327ex), that made a blog Love2d where I learned a lot of things, also he made too many libreries to use love2d.
