Here is your corrected markdown, with orthographic and grammatical errors fixed:

LAMP is an abbreviation for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. On Windows, there's a simple software called XAMPP that installs and configures those components to work together.

In addition, XAMPP provides a user interface to manage databases, called **phpMyAdmin**. But on Linux, itâ€™s a different story because you need to follow a YouTube or Stack Overflow tutorial to set up everything manually.

## Update Your System

That's why I decided to share my solution for this situation. This solution works on Ubuntu 24 LTS.

```
sudo apt update

```

## Set Up Apache 2

```
sudo apt install apache2
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow in "Apache"
sudo ufw status # If inactive, run: sudo ufw enable

```

## Set Up MySQL

```
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql

```

Replace `'password'` with your desired root password in the following command:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password'; # Set up root password
exit

```

## Set Up PHP

```
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

```

## Set Up phpMyAdmin

When you install phpMyAdmin, use the same password you chose earlier. Also, select Apache in the configuration screen.

```
# Set up phpMyAdmin
sudo apt install phpmyadmin -y
sudo apt install -y php-json php-mbstring php-zip php-gd php-curl
sudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf
sudo a2enconf phpmyadmin.conf
sudo phpenmod mbstring
sudo systemctl reload apache2

```
