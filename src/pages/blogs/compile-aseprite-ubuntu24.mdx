Recently, I compiled the program [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite), which is incredibly useful for creating pixel art. However, the process can be somewhat tedious if you're not familiar with it. Here, Iâ€™ll share my solution.

## 1. Install Dependencies
First, we need to install the necessary dependencies, including `cmake` and `ninja`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y g++ clang libc++-dev libc++abi-dev cmake ninja-build libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libfontconfig1-dev
```

## 2. Compiling the Program

Start by downloading the Aseprite and Skia resources. For this guide, Iâ€™ll use Aseprite version 1.3.7. Iâ€™ve encountered some issues compiling newer versions, but Iâ€™m working on resolving them.

- [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/releases/tag/v1.3.7)
- [Skia](https://github.com/aseprite/skia/releases/tag/m102-861e4743af)

After downloading, extract the archives and rename the folders to `aseprite` and `skia` respectively. Then move these folders to your system's `$HOME` directory.

Open a terminal inside the `aseprite` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DLAF_BACKEND=skia \
  -DSKIA_DIR=$HOME/deps/skia \
  -DSKIA_LIBRARY_DIR=$HOME/deps/skia/out/Release-x64 \
  -DSKIA_LIBRARY=$HOME/deps/skia/out/Release-x64/libskia.a \
  -G Ninja \
  ..
ninja aseprite
```

After about 10 minutes of compilation, you will find the following structure inside `$HOME/aseprite/build`:

```bash
/aseprite
  /build
    data (dir)
    aseprite (bin)
    gen (bin)
```

To verify the compilation, run the `./aseprite` binary. If everything went well, **Aseprite v1.3.7dev** should open. Otherwise, retry the steps and consult the [installation file](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md) in the repository for more details.

## 3. Exposing the Binary Files to the System
First, move the binary files (`aseprite` and `gen`) and the `data` directory to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo mv $HOME/aseprite/build/* /usr/local/bin
```

Next, create a `.desktop` file so the system can recognize the program:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/aseprite.desktop
```

Inside this file, write the following:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Aseprite
Exec=/usr/local/bin/aseprite
Icon=/usr/local/bin/aseprite-icon.png (preferred icon image path)
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Utility;
```

> NOTE: In `nano`, use `Ctrl-O` to save and `Ctrl-X` to exit. 
> For the icon, move the image to the correct location using the following command:
```bash
sudo cp $HOME/Downloads/aseprite-icon.png /usr/local/bin
```

Finally, execute the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
sudo update-desktop-database   
gtk-launch aseprite                                                                                       
```

Aseprite should now launch successfully! ðŸŽ‰
